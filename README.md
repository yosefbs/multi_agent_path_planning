## Dependencies

Install the necessary dependencies by running.

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Centralized Solutions

In these methods, it is the responsibility of the central planner to provide a plan to the robots.

### Prioritized Safe-Interval Path Planning

SIPP is a local planner, using which, a collision-free plan can be generated, after considering the static and dynamic obstacles in the environment. In the case of multi-agent path planning, the other agents in the environment are considered as dynamic obstacles. 

#### Execution

For SIPP multi-agent prioritized planning, run:

``` 
cd ./centralized/sipp
python3 multi_sipp.py input.yaml output.yaml
```

#### Results

To visualize the generated results

``` 
python3 visualize_sipp.py input.yaml output.yaml 
```

To record video

``` 
python3 visualize_sipp.py input.yaml output.yaml --video 'sipp.avi' --speed 1
```

### Conflict Based Search

Conclict-Based Search (CBS), is a multi-agent global path planner.

#### Execution

Run:

``` 
cd ./centralized/cbs
python3 cbs.py input.yaml output.yaml
```

#### Results

To visualize the generated results:

``` shell
python3 ../visualize.py input.yaml output.yaml
```

### Post-Processing

#### Post-processing with TPG

The plan, which is computed in discrete time, can be postprocessed to generate a plan-execution schedule, that takes care of the kinematic constraints as well as imperfections in plan execution.

This work is based on: [Multi-Agent Path Finding with Kinematic Constraints](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICAPS/ICAPS16/paper/view/13183/12711)

Once the plan is generated using CBS, please run the following to generate the plan-execution schedule:

``` shell
cd ./centralized/scheduling
python3 minimize.py ../cbs/output.yaml real_schedule.yaml
```

## Decentralized solutions

In this approach, it is the responsibility of each robot to find a feasible path. Each robot sees other robots as dynamic obstacles, and tries to compute a control velocity which would avoid collisions with these dynamic obstacles.

### Velocity obstacles

#### Execution

```shell
cd ./decentralized
python3 decentralized.py -f velocity_obstacle/velocity_obstacle.avi -m velocity_obstacle
```

#### Results

- Test 1: The robot tries to stay at (0, 0), while avoiding collisions with the dynamic obstacles
- Test 2: The robot moves from (5, 0) to (5, 10), while avoiding obstacles

### Nonlinear Model-Predictive Control

#### Execution

```shell
cd ./decentralized
python3 decentralized.py -m nmpc
```

#### Results

- Test 1: The robot tries to stay at (0, 0), while avoiding collisions with the dynamic obstacles
- Test 2: The robot moves from (5, 0) to (5, 10), while avoiding obstacles
